In their annual report it says that the gaming and hotel businesses pose limited risks to the environment due to the service nature of the industry. Tsogo Sun operates predominantly in urban areas, which further reduces the biodiversity impact. The main environmental impacts of the group are the consumption of energy and water, the production of waste and travel of guests to their hotels. This shows that Tsogo Sun are aware of their energy and water waste but continue to operate in mostly urban areas and thus reduces the biodiversity impact on the environment.
